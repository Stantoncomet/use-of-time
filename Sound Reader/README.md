#  Sound Reader
This is the orginal, minimalistic sound reader program. It's apparently slightly less confusing to use than the second version, but even so, here are some things to keep in mind.

## Setup
1. Download `Sounder_Reader_v1.0.0.html` from the releases page.
2. Place the html file in a folder.
3. Create an `audio` folder in the same place as the html file, so they sit next to each other.
4. In the `audio` folder, create organizational subfolders, like `fx` or `music` or `act1 `. These can be any name, though some special names like `sound` or `song` will create tracks with special background colors.
5. These subfolders are where you put the audio files. Usually stick to `.mp3` files.

6. Once set up is complete, double-click to open the html file in your browser (currently supported browsers are: Chrome, Edge, Brave).
7. Click `Select Audio Folder` and choose the `audio` folder from step 3.
8. Confirm and you're done! Some tracks will take a while to load and appear grayed-out, please just wait patiently until they do.
